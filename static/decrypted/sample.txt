This will print the file path to the console, allowing you to check if it's correct.

Summary Checklist:
Verify the file exists in the expected folder (UPLOAD_FOLDER).
Ensure Flask can access the folder with proper permissions.
Check that the filename passed in the URL matches the actual file name (including case).
Ensure the file path is being formed correctly in your route.
If serving the file to a client, make sure you're using send_from_directory() properly.
If the problem persists after checking these points, please provide more information about the exact error you're encountering or share the structure of your Flask application so I can help further.
